    "Stack Exchange Personalized Prediction Data is the data which Stack Exchange (which contains Stack Overflow) has accumulated from the user behavior to make prediction for personal recommendation such as job listings. See [here](https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/prediction-data) for official explanation. \n",

    "Stack Exchange allows users to download their personalized data. The data contains information which describes our behavior using things like tags (c++, javascript, python, etc. for my case) with some coefficients. Although there is no documentation about what each value means, it is interesting to see what it looks like.\n",
